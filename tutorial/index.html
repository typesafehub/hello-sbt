    <h2>Introduction to sbt</h2>

    <p>
        sbt is a build tool that brings convention over configuration and the flexibility of customizing
        builds without requiring a deep understanding of the tool. Projects of simple to medium complexity
        should be easy to configure using sbt.
    </p>

    <h2>Why sbt</h2>

    <p>
        There are some great build tools out there - why the need for yet another? The well
        known tool named ANT is actually an acronym for <b>Another</b> Neat Tool; and ANT has been
        around since the year 2000!
    </p>

    <p>
        Maven was quite
        revolutionary when it was introduced given its main goal of "project comprehension".
        Other developers should be able to come to your project and rapidly comprehend
        its structure and build behaviors given convention. Prior to Maven many build tools
        provided a great deal of flexibility but it was often difficult to rapidly become
        familiar with the associated project.

    <p>
        Gradle is another great tool that has a focus on project comprehension
        but it also permits the build to be customised quite easily. The approach to
        customisation is simpler than with Maven though and this is of great appeal to
        many developers.
    </p>

    <p>
        sbt has similar goals to Gradle in that project comprehension is an important
        concern. sbt is also very flexible in permitting custom builds.
    </p>

    <p>
        What distinguishes sbt is that it takes on a functional approach to expressing a build. Build scripts are
        aggregated to form an immutable dependency graph of settings and tasks in order
        to perform a build. Commands are used to transition one state of a build to a new
        state. More on settings, tasks and commands later.
    </p>

    <p>
        Given sbt's functional approach a high degree of parallelism can be
        achieved. The motivation for sbt is therefore performance
        while also being able to leverage the design of build tools that came
        before it; in particular to hold the torch of project comprehension high.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>The Command Line Interface (CLI)</h2>
    <p>
        Another point of differentiation with sbt is that it is not just a tool for building your project's target.
        sbt is also an interactive development environment in that a
        CLI is provided where you can obtain the value of settings, evaluate tasks and perform commands.
    </p>
    <p>
        sbt can be invoked via typing <code>activator</code> or <code>sbt</code>. Activator is a great
        place to get started (you're using it now!) and its CLI allows you to jump into its UI and also
        select templates. For now though, we'll use the sbt command to refer to invoking either
        Activator or sbt.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sbt command accepts parameters where each parameter is an sbt command e.g:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
sbt compile
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        The above will compile your project. If you type <code>sbt</code> without any command parameter then it will
        launch you into an interactive session where you can assign, evaluate and perform commands.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>The Anatomy of an sbt project</h2>

    <p>
        To get started with sbt you don't need anything other than Scala or Java source
        in the familiar <a href="#code/src/main/scala/org/example" class="shortcut">src/main/scala</a>
        or src/main/java directories. You can just type the
        <code>sbt</code> command at the root level of that project and start compiling and
        running code.
    </p>

    <h3>The Build File</h3>

    <p>
        While you can do the above it is more typical that a project has a
        <a href="#code/build.sbt" class="shortcut">build.sbt</a> file. A common question
        when people first see a build.sbt file is, "why the blank lines?". There are
        historical reasons for this with one being that each line is a distinct compilation
        unit. Thus build.sbt files are incrementally compiled. Given advances in Scala
        incremental compilation this constraint may be relaxed in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        A project typically declares its organization, name and version. While not strictly
        necessary it is also considered good practice to declare the version of Scala to use.
        If this is not declared then the project's Scala version will correspond to the
        version used by sbt.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our build shows that <code>scalaiformSettings</code> are to be used. This is how
        a plugin's settings are declared. The settings are simply a sequence of descriptors that specify
        the default build configuration for the given plugin. The appearance of <code>scalaiformSettings</code>
        here actually tells sbt to format Scala code in a conventional manner before
        performing a compilation. You don't need these settings or this plugin; it is shown
        here merely as an example of how a plugin can be referenced.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>libraryDependencies</code> is a setting that you'll find yourself assigning
        to a great deal. These are the libraries that your project depends on. sbt has a short-hand
        notation for expressing the coordinates of a library; typically three strings separated with a
        <code>%</code> character. The format is:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
organization + "%" [+ "%"] + name + "%" + version
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        The additional <code>%</code> can appear between the organization and name to indicate which
        version of the library should be used in accordance with the version of Scala being used for the
        project. Java libraries do not hold this convention; it is only used when referencing Scala
        libraries in order to resolve the correct binary level compatibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our <code>libraryDependencies</code> here indicate that we are to use the Specs2 test library for performing
        the project's tests.
    </p>

    <p>
        The last section is concerned with publishing and we will come back to this later.
    </p>

    <p>
        build.sbt files can also be represented using a Scala file in the project's
        <a href="#code/project" class="shortcut">project</a> folder. We don't have any Scala files
        there but be assured that the <a href="#code/build.sbt" class="shortcut">build.sbt</a> is roughly equivalent to:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
import sbt._
import Keys._

object MyBuild extends Build {
  val helloSbt =
    project.in(file(".")).settings(Seq(
      organization := "org.example",
      name := "hello-sbt",
      version := "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT",
      scalaVersion := "2.10.3",
      scalacOptions += "-deprecation",
      ...
    ))
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>The Project Folder</h3>

    <p>
        Any <code>.sbt</code> or <code>.scala</code> files in the <a href="#code/project" class="shortcut">project</a>
        folder will be compiled and
        used for the build. This powerful facility accommodates the crafting of complex tasks that can be invoked
        as part of the build. <code>build.sbt</code> files also permit a great deal of flexibility and so are
        typically used for the bulk of build declaration; what we call the "shape of the build". build.sbt should
        be able to be referenced and comprehended at a glance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Two other files commonly found here are:
    <ul>
        <li>build.properties</li>
        <li>plugins.sbt</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="#code/project/build.properties" class="shortcut">build.properties</a> is used primarily to
        describe the version of sbt to be used by the project. One really nice feature of sbt is that you can launch
        other versions of sbt to build a project, and the version of sbt that is required by the project
        will always be used.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/project/plugins.sbt" class="shortcut">plugins.sbt</a> declares the plugins that will be used
        by the project. The file is named so by convention, but you could easily use <code>scalaiform.sbt</code>
        to declare a corresponding dependency instead. If you have many plugins then this approach may be more
        suitable in order to reduce the length and complexity of a single <code>plugins.sbt</code> file.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>addSbtPlugin</code> is slightly different to simply adding a dependency on to the
        <code>libraryDependencies</code> setting. Adding an sbt plugin will also seek a plugin associated with the
        version of sbt and its corresponding Scala version.
    </p>

    <p>
        The rest of the project structure may be familiar to you if you come from Maven or Gradle.
        <code>src/main</code> and <code>src/test</code> provide source for the main and testing classpaths
        respectively. <code>target</code> is where build artifacts such as jar files are constructed.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Settings</h2>

    <p>
        Settings provide your build configuration. Settings are values evaluated once and then cached for next time.
        Here is an example of a setting being declared and then assigned:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
val mySetting = setting[Boolean]("Some boolean setting")

mySetting := true
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Note the <code>:=</code> assignment operator. This is a special symbol declaring that <code>true</code>
        should be assigned to the value of the setting described by <code>mySetting</code>. The
        <code>=</code> operator and the <code>:=</code> operator are not the same.
    </p>

    <p>
        Settings may depend on other settings e.g.:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
val anotherSetting = setting[String]("Some other setting")

anotherSetting := mySetting.value.toString
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        The <code>.value</code> method access not only retrieves the value associated with the setting,
        but it also declares that <code>anotherSetting</code> has a dependency on the <code>mySetting</code>
        setting. sbt will form a dependency graph of settings and ensure that <code>mySetting</code> is
        assigned before <code>anotherSetting</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the setting is declared as a sequence then you can append to it:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
scalacOptions += "-deprecated"

scalacOptions ++= Seq("-deprecated", "-feature")
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        sbt declares many standard settings
        e.g. <a href="#code/build.sbt" class="shortcut"><code>scalacOptions</code></a>
        so you should always look first in sbt's <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13.1/api/index.html#sbt.Keys$">sbt.Keys Scala source</a> to see if there is one you can use before
        declaring your own.
    </p>

</div>
<div>
    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <p>
        Tasks are similar to settings with the main difference being that they are evaluated once per build. Here is
        an example task declaration and assignment:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
val myTask = task[String]("some task")

myTask := "Hello world"
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Tasks may depend on other tasks <b>and</b> settings where settings can only depend on other settings.
        Just like settings, tasks
        can also be appended to if they are declared as a sequence.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Commands</h2>
    <p>
        You generally don't end up creating your own commands (although you certainly can). Command examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>compile</li>
        <li>test</li>
        <li>clean</li>
        <li>update</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Commands take the state of a previous build and produce a new state. Commands can also take parameters
        and generally depend on tasks and settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Commands can also watch for files to change. This is done by prefixing a command with a <code>~</code>.
        For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
~test
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        In the above, testing will occur when a file changes.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Multi-Project Builds</h2>
    <p>
        Multiple projects sharing the same parent hierarchy are easy to accommodate and come in two forms:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>classpath; and</li>
        <li>aggregate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A regular sub-project structure simply requires that there is a sub-folder to the parent.
        There is no project folder for a sub project as project build meta data is shared
        across the parent and the sub projects. For example the parent project will declare the plugins that the
        the sub projects will use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given a sub-project folder the parent build.sbt file will declare the following:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
lazy val root = project.in(file("."))

lazy val mysubproj = project.dependsOn(root)
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        In the above, <code>mysubproj</code> is also the name of the sub-directory (this can be overridden with a
        <code>.in</code> method call). The <code>dependsOn</code> makes the classpath of the root project
        available to the <code>mysubproj</code> sub-project.
    </p>

    <p>
        Declaring the <code>val</code> as a <code>lazy val</code> isn't a strict requirement above but,
        if used, the order of declarations becomes less important. It is therefore considered good practice to use
        lazy declarations when using the <code>project</code> function.
    </p>

    <p>
        Aggregate projects can be declared such that commands and tasks performed on the root project will be performed on
        the associated projects. This behavior is similar to Maven when operating on a parent pom file. To declare
        an aggregate project:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
lazy val root = project.in(file(".")).aggregate(mysubproj)

lazy val mysubproj = project
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Performing a <code>compile</code> command on the root project will be performed on all of the
        aggregated projects. Note how that this time, <code>mysubproj</code> cannot depend on the root given
        that they'd be a circular dependency in Scala. Also aggregated projects can be built in parallel and
        therefore cannot depend on each other.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Publishing</h2>
    <p>
        Toward the end of the <a href="#code/build.sbt" class="shortcut">build.sbt</a> file is a section
        devoted to publishing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Build artifacts can be published either in ivy or Maven form; their repository structures are
        different. In general ivy is used for publishing plugins or private repositories and Maven is for
        public repositories to be consumed by multiple build tools.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>publishTo</code> key declares the repository that will be used for publishing
        depending on whether the project version indicates a
        final release or development release. When publishing you will also need to consider whether
        credentials are required. The sbt documentation details how credentials are provided.
    </p>

    <p>
        When publishing to Sonatype or other Maven repositories then constraints may be enforced requiring
        the type of license being used, the name of the developer etc. <code>pomExtra</code> declares
        the additional XML required to be included in the published artifact's metadata.
    </p>

    <p>
        To perform a publish you can do one of the following three commands:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>publish-local</code></li>
        <li><code>publish</code></li>
        <li><code>publish-signed</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <code>publish-local</code> is used for development purposes and will publish to your local ivy
        repository. <code>publish</code> will publish to the repository indicated by the <code>publishTo</code>
        setting. <code>publishSigned</code> will do the same as <code>publish</code> but also sign the
        artifact using PGP.
    </p>
</div>
